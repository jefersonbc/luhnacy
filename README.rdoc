= luhnacy

A tiny (hopefully) gem that will automate some of the painful tasks of generating / validating strings of numbers based on the Luhn algorithm (e.g. credit card numbers, ID numbers).

== Usage

To validate:

  Luhnacy.valid?('49927398716')

To generate a string of 10 digits that satisfies the Luhn algorithm:

  valid_string = Luhnacy.generate(10)

To generate a string of 10 digits that does not satisfy Luhn algorithm:

  invalid_string = Luhnacy.generate(10, :invalid => true)

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
